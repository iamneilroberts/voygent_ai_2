-- Update existing instructions with new references and enhancements

-- 1. Update mobile-mode to reference image optimization and commission tracking
UPDATE instruction_sets 
SET content = '# Mobile Mode - Autonomous Lead Processing

## When Triggered:
- Messages with `[MOBILE]` prefix
- Agent relay phrases: "Just got off the phone with...", "New lead:"
- Casual travel lead descriptions

## Core Workflow:
1. **Parse Lead Information**
   - Extract: client names, budget, destinations, dates, group size, departure location
   - Assume reasonable defaults for missing info

2. **Create Basic Trip Structure**
   - Create client records using `create_client`
   - Set up trip using `create_trip`
   - Link clients via TripParticipants

3. **Three-Tier Pricing Outline**

- End each response with: `[ðŸ¤– AUTONOMOUS]`',
updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE name = 'mobile-mode';

-- 4. Update trip_discovery to reference interview mode and next steps
UPDATE instruction_sets 
SET content = '# Comprehensive Trip Discovery

## Quick Start Option
For a guided interview experience, load the "client-interview-mode" instruction for a conversational, one-question-at-a-time approach.

## Information Gathering Phase:
1. **Client Profile**
   - Travel experience level
   - Budget range (get specific number)
   - Group composition (ages, relationships)
   - Special needs/preferences

2. **Trip Logistics**
   - Destination (primary + alternatives)
   - Travel dates (flexible vs fixed)
   - Duration (minimum/maximum)
   - Departure location

3. **Experience Preferences**
   - Travel style (luxury, adventure, cultural, relaxation)
   - Accommodation preferences
   - Activity interests
   - Dining preferences

## Discovery Techniques:
- **Open-ended questions**: "Tell me about your dream trip..."
- **Specific probes**: "What''s most important - saving money or unique experiences?"
- **Trade-off scenarios**: "Would you prefer 7 days luxury or 10 days mid-range?"

## Red Flags to Address:
- Unrealistic budget expectations
- Unclear decision-making authority
- Conflicting group preferences
- Inflexible requirements

## Next Steps After Discovery:
- When ready to search hotels â†’ retrieve "cpmaxx-search" instruction
- When planning daily activities â†’ retrieve "daily-planning" instruction
- For activity ideas â†’ retrieve "kims-gems-daily" instruction
- For tour options â†’ retrieve "viator-integration" instruction

## Output: Complete Client Profile
Document all findings in trip_notes JSON for proposal development. Note commission opportunities as discovered.',
updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE name = 'trip_discovery';

-- 5. Update cpmaxx_search to include image capture workflow
UPDATE instruction_sets 
SET content = '# CPMaxx Hotel Search Process

2. **Tier 2**: Click into hotel details if needed
   - Navigate photo galleries
   - Extract each image URL
3. **Tier 3**: Screenshot specific hotels only if URLs unavailable

## Quality Control:

- Confirm availability dates
- Check for hidden fees
- Validate cancellation terms
- Calculate commission potential

## Storage:
Store all results in trip_notes JSON with:
- Hotel comparison matrix

updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE name = 'cpmaxx_search';

-- 6. Update three-tier-pricing to include commission optimization notes
UPDATE instruction_sets 
SET content = '# Three-Tier Proposal System

## Tier Structure (Discover/Elevate/Transcend):

### Discover (Budget Anchor): 75% of stated budget
- **Purpose**: Make other tiers attractive, anchor low expectations
- **Components**: Economy flights, 3-star hotels, public transport, self-guided activities
- **Revenue**: Hotel commissions (8-12%) + service markup (10-15%) = **18-27% total margin**

### Elevate (Target Tier): 110% of stated budget  
- **Purpose**: Highest profitability, most selections (target 60-70% selection rate)
- **Components**: Premium economy/business flights, 4-star boutique hotels, private transfers for key segments, guided experiences  
- **Revenue**: Hotel commissions (10-15%) + service markup (25-35%) = **35-50% total margin**
- **Commission Note**: This tier typically generates the optimal net commission due to balanced pricing and higher commission rates

### Transcend (Premium): 175% of stated budget
- **Purpose**: Justify middle tier, capture high-spenders
- **Components**: Business/first class flights, 5-star luxury, private transport, VIP experiences
- **Revenue**: Hotel commissions (12-15%) + service markup (20-30%) = **32-45% total margin**

## Proposal Structure:
1. **Executive Summary**: "Three ways to experience [destination]"
2. **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Clear feature matrix
3. **Detailed Itineraries**: Day-by-day for each tier
4. **Investment Summary**: Total pricing, payment options
5. **Urgency Elements**: Booking deadlines, availability pressure

## Commission Optimization:
- Present Elevate tier most attractively (highest net commission)
- Include Viator tours in all tiers (8% commission)
- Add travel insurance to all options (30-40% commission)
- Consider service fees if commission targets not met

## Critical Notes:
- **Service markups are NEVER disclosed** in client documents
- Use "investment" not "cost" in communications
- Frame as "experience levels" not "budget options"
- Track expected commission for each tier internally',
updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE name = 'three-tier-pricing';
