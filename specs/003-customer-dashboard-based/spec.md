## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A travel agent with an active subscription visits their personalized customer dashboard (similar to somotravel.us) to access their client itineraries, travel templates, booking resources, and account information. The dashboard is published as a static site that updates when their data changes, providing fast access to curated travel planning materials without requiring server-side rendering.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a travel agent with an active subscription, **When** they visit their unique dashboard URL, **Then** they see their personalized homepage with their agency branding and current client itineraries
2. **Given** a travel agent viewing their dashboard, **When** they navigate to the templates section, **Then** they see all available travel templates they have access to based on their subscription tier
3. **Given** a travel agent with expired subscription, **When** they attempt to access their dashboard, **Then** they see a subscription renewal prompt with limited read-only access to archived content
4. **Given** new content is added to a travel agent's account, **When** the dashboard regenerates, **Then** the updated static pages reflect the new content within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable update latency - seconds, minutes, hours?]
5. **Given** a travel agent sharing a dashboard link, **When** an unauthorized user attempts to access it, **Then** they are [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: blocked entirely, shown public preview, or redirected to login?]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a travel agent's subscription is in grace period (expired but not yet terminated)?
- How does the system handle dashboard access if the agent has multiple subscription tiers or multiple agency affiliations?
- What content is retained or purged when a subscription is canceled?
- How are dashboard URLs managed if an agent changes their business name or agency?
- What happens if the dashboard generation fails (e.g., corrupted data, storage limits exceeded)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Access & Authentication
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide each subscribed travel agent with a unique, persistent dashboard URL
- **FR-002**: System MUST control dashboard access based on subscription status (active, expired, canceled)
- **FR-003**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authentication method - password-protected, SSO, magic link, or public URL with obscurity?]

#### Content & Personalization
- **FR-004**: Dashboard MUST display travel agent's business identity (name, branding, contact information)
- **FR-005**: Dashboard MUST present client itineraries associated with the travel agent's account
- **FR-006**: Dashboard MUST provide access to travel templates based on subscription tier
- **FR-007**: Dashboard MUST include [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what additional sections - booking tools, resource library, analytics, client management?]
- **FR-008**: Dashboard MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: navigation structure - single-page, multi-page, hierarchical, tabbed?]

#### Subscription Integration
- **FR-009**: System MUST reflect subscription tier in available dashboard features and content
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle subscription state changes (upgrade, downgrade, renewal, cancellation) by [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: immediately updating dashboard, at next generation cycle, or manual refresh?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: when subscription expires - preserve full dashboard read-only, show limited preview, or redirect to renewal page?]

#### Data Management
- **FR-012**: System MUST regenerate dashboard when agent's content is updated
- **FR-013**: System MUST retain dashboard content for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period after subscription cancellation - 30 days, 90 days, indefinitely?]
- **FR-014**: Dashboard MUST display content freshness indicator showing last update time

#### Performance & Availability
- **FR-015**: Dashboard MUST load within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target page load time - 1s, 3s, 5s?] on standard broadband connection
- **FR-016**: Dashboard MUST be accessible [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: availability target - 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%?]
- **FR-017**: Dashboard MUST support concurrent access by [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: expected concurrent users per dashboard - single agent only, agent + clients, agent + team?]

#### Security & Privacy
- **FR-018**: System MUST prevent unauthorized access to agent dashboards
- **FR-019**: System MUST not expose other agents' data through dashboard URLs
- **FR-020**: Dashboard MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: client data privacy - is client PII displayed, and if so, what protection measures?]

### Key Entities

- **Client Itinerary**: Travel plans associated with an agent; displayed on their dashboard
- **Travel Template**: Reusable travel planning documents; accessible based on subscription tier
- **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: are there additional entities like Agency (if agents belong to agencies), Dashboard Theme, or Resource Collections?]**
