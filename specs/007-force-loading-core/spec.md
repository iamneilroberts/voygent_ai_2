# Feature Specification: Force Loading Core Instructions on LibreChat Startup

**Feature Branch**: `007-force-loading-core`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "-force loading core-instructions on librechat startup or give a prominent button or simple /voygent command for now."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature identified: ensure Voygent core instructions are loaded
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: LibreChat users, system administrators
   ‚Üí Actions: force-load instructions, trigger via button/command
   ‚Üí Data: core-instructions content
   ‚Üí Constraints: startup OR user-initiated trigger
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are "core-instructions"? A system prompt/context file?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should force-loading be mandatory (blocking startup) or optional?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: If button approach, where should button be placed in UI?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should /voygent command replace or supplement startup loading?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What happens if core-instructions fail to load?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow partially clear but ambiguities remain
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement marked with clarification needs
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Core Instructions entity identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - multiple [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for clarification phase)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02
- Q: What mechanism should trigger loading of core instructions? ‚Üí A: Both ‚Äì Auto-load on startup + manual trigger as backup/reload option
- Q: What user interface element(s) should be provided for manual reloading? ‚Üí A: Slash command only
- Q: If automatic loading fails on startup, should the system block usage or allow graceful degradation? ‚Üí A: Allow with warning ‚Äì Show error but let user proceed (with option to retry via `/voygent`)
- Q: What visual feedback states should be shown to users? ‚Üí A: All states ‚Äì Show loading indicator, success confirmation, and error messages
- Q: Should loaded core instructions persist across browser page refreshes? ‚Üí A: Persist ‚Äì Instructions remain loaded after page refresh (stored in browser)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Voygent user, I need the system to automatically load Voygent-specific instructions when LibreChat starts, OR provide me with an easy way to trigger loading these instructions, so that the AI assistant behaves according to Voygent's travel planning capabilities and context from the first interaction.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** LibreChat is starting up for the first time (no persisted instructions), **When** the application initializes, **Then** system shows a loading indicator, automatically loads core instructions, persists them to browser storage, and displays a success confirmation

2. **Given** LibreChat is starting up with previously persisted instructions, **When** the application initializes, **Then** system restores instructions from browser storage without showing a loading indicator

3. **Given** a user is in an active LibreChat session with instructions already loaded, **When** they type the `/voygent` slash command, **Then** system shows a loading indicator, reloads core instructions, updates persisted storage, and displays a success confirmation

4. **Given** automatic loading failed on startup, **When** the user types the `/voygent` slash command, **Then** system shows a loading indicator, attempts to load core instructions, and displays success or error feedback

5. **Given** core instructions fail to load on startup, **When** the error occurs, **Then** system displays an error message and allows the user to proceed with chat interactions, with the option to retry loading via the `/voygent` command

### Edge Cases
- What happens when core instructions are updated while users have active sessions?
- How does the system handle partial or corrupted core instruction content?
- Can users disable or override force-loaded instructions?
- What happens if browser storage is unavailable or full when attempting to persist instructions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Loading Mechanism:**
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically load Voygent core instructions on LibreChat startup
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a slash command to reload core instructions as a backup/recovery option
- **FR-003**: System MUST make core instructions available to the AI conversation context once loaded
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to proceed with chat interactions even if automatic loading fails on startup

**User Interface:**
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a slash command (e.g., `/voygent`) to manually reload core instructions
- **FR-006**: System MUST display a loading indicator while core instructions are being loaded
- **FR-007**: System MUST display a success confirmation message when core instructions load successfully
- **FR-008**: System MUST display a warning/error message when automatic loading fails, informing the user they can retry via the slash command

**Error Handling:**
- **FR-009**: System MUST display an error message when core instruction loading fails, without blocking user interactions
- **FR-010**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: log loading attempts and failures for debugging?]

**Session Management:**
- **FR-011**: System MUST persist loaded core instructions across browser page refreshes (e.g., using browser storage)
- **FR-012**: System MUST restore persisted core instructions on subsequent page loads without requiring manual reload
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow users to start conversations at any time, regardless of whether instructions are loaded (graceful degradation)

### Key Entities

- **Core Instructions**: The Voygent-specific system prompt or context that configures the AI assistant's behavior for travel planning tasks. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is this a text file, database record, API response, or environment variable? What is the expected size/complexity?]

## Next Steps

This specification requires clarification on the following key decision points:

1. **Loading Strategy**: Automatic on startup vs. user-initiated vs. both?
2. **Core Instructions Source**: Where do these instructions come from and what format?
3. **UI Approach**: Button, slash command, or both?
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation or hard requirement?
5. **Persistence**: Session-based or page-refresh-resistant?

Please review and provide clarification to unblock the planning phase.
