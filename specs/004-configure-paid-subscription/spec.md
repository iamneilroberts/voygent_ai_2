## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a travel agent, I want to try Voygent AI with a free tier that allows me to create one active trip itinerary to evaluate the platform, and if I find value, upgrade to a paid subscription for unlimited itineraries and higher usage limits, while the system prevents abuse of the free tier through rate limiting.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Free Tier User Journey:**
1. **Given** a new user signs up for the free tier, **When** they access Voygent AI, **Then** they can create 1 active itinerary
2. **Given** a free user has 1 active itinerary, **When** they attempt to create a second active itinerary, **Then** the system blocks creation and prompts them to upgrade or archive the existing itinerary
3. **Given** a free user archives their itinerary, **When** they create a new itinerary, **Then** the system allows it (maintaining the 1 active limit)
4. **Given** a free user exceeds rate limits, **When** they make additional requests, **Then** the system temporarily blocks requests and displays a message [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What rate limit thresholds? Requests per hour/day?]
5. **Given** a free user is rate limited, **When** the cooldown period expires, **Then** the system allows normal usage again

**Paid Tier User Journey:**
6. **Given** a free user wants more itineraries, **When** they upgrade to a paid tier, **Then** their itinerary limit increases immediately [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the paid tier limits? Unlimited or specific number?]
7. **Given** a paid user creates multiple itineraries, **When** they work on different client trips, **Then** all itineraries remain active without archiving
8. **Given** a paid user makes frequent requests, **When** usage is monitored, **Then** they experience [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Higher rate limits, or no rate limits at all?]

**Subscription Management:**
9. **Given** a paid user's subscription expires, **When** the billing period ends without renewal, **Then** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Do they revert to free tier? Grace period? Itineraries archived?]
10. **Given** a paid user cancels their subscription, **When** they continue using Voygent, **Then** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Immediate downgrade or finish current billing period?]

**Abuse Prevention:**
11. **Given** a free user attempts to abuse the system through rapid account creation, **When** suspicious patterns are detected, **Then** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: IP-based blocking? Email verification requirements? Cooldown periods?]
12. **Given** a user attempts to circumvent rate limits, **When** the system detects the attempt, **Then** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Temporary ban? Permanent ban? Admin notification?]

### Edge Cases
- What happens if a free user upgrades while rate-limited?
- How does the system handle users who had multiple active itineraries before the subscription system was implemented (legacy users)?
- What if a paid user downgrades mid-billing cycle with 5 active itineraries?
- Should archived itineraries count toward storage limits?
- How are "active" vs "archived" itineraries defined?
- What if a user shares their account to circumvent limits?
- Should trial periods be offered for paid tiers?
- How to handle partial month billing if user upgrades mid-cycle?
- What happens to active itineraries if payment fails?

**Dependencies:**
- User authentication and account management system
- Payment processing integration (e.g., Stripe)
- Usage tracking and analytics system
- Notification system (email, in-app)
- Admin dashboard for subscription management

**Assumptions:**
- Free tier is designed for evaluation/trial, not long-term production use
- Paid tiers provide revenue to sustain service operations
- Rate limiting should be generous enough to not frustrate legitimate free users
- Most free users will upgrade if they find value
- Abuse will be attempted and must be actively prevented
- Subscription changes should be self-service where possible
