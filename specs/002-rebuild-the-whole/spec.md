## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02
- Q: Where should the rebuilt LibreChat with customizations be located? ‚Üí A: Replace existing `apps/librechat/` in Voygent_ai_2 repo with full customizations

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on Voygent, I need to rebuild the LibreChat application with all Voygent customizations (branding, StatusBar, token tracking, trip progress features) integrated into the current repository structure, so that I can deploy a working application with all custom features functioning correctly.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the Voygent customizations exist in `/home/neil/dev/voygen/librechat-source`, **When** the rebuild process completes, **Then** all customization files are properly integrated into `apps/librechat/` directory in Voygent_ai_2 repository
2. **Given** the build completes successfully, **When** the application starts, **Then** it displays Voygent branding (logo, title "Voygent - AI Travel Planning")
3. **Given** the application is running, **When** a user interacts with the chat interface, **Then** the StatusBar component displays token usage information
4. **Given** the application is running, **When** backend API endpoints are queried, **Then** `/api/voygen/status`, `/api/voygen/start`, and other Voygent-specific routes respond correctly
5. **Given** all features are integrated, **When** running the full test suite (unit, integration, E2E), **Then** all tests pass without errors
6. **Given** the rebuild is complete, **When** deployed to Render.com, **Then** the application starts successfully with all health checks passing and Voygent features functional

### Edge Cases
- What happens when dependencies are missing or incompatible? (Build must fail with clear error messages identifying missing dependencies)
- How does the system handle conflicts between LibreChat base code and Voygent customizations? (Voygent customizations take precedence; conflicts documented)
- What happens if the build process fails partway through? (Clean rollback to previous state; no partial builds deployed)
- How are existing configurations preserved or migrated? (Configuration backed up before rebuild; migration path documented)
- What happens when required environment variables are missing at runtime? (Application fails to start with explicit error listing missing vars)
- How does the system behave when MCP servers are unreachable? (Graceful degradation; StatusBar shows connection status; core chat functionality remains available)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Build & Integration
- **FR-001**: System MUST successfully build the LibreChat application with all Voygent customizations integrated (branding, StatusBar, VoygenWelcome, backend routes, corrected MCP server configurations)
- **FR-002**: System MUST preserve all existing Voygent branding elements (logo, favicon, theme CSS, title metadata)
- **FR-003**: System MUST include all custom React components (StatusBar, VoygenWelcome) in the built application
- **FR-004**: System MUST integrate all Voygent-specific Recoil state atoms and selectors
- **FR-005**: System MUST include all backend API routes for Voygent features (`/api/voygen/*` endpoints)

#### Application Functionality
- **FR-006**: Application MUST display "Voygent - AI Travel Planning" branding in browser title and UI
- **FR-007**: Application MUST render the StatusBar component showing token usage when available
- **FR-008**: Application MUST respond to `/api/voygen/status` requests with trip/token status data
- **FR-009**: Application MUST respond to `/api/voygen/start` requests to initialize Voygent backend services
- **FR-010**: Application MUST maintain compatibility with LibreChat's MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration with corrected server list (chrome, d1_database, prompt_instructions, template_document - not the incorrect list shown in current UI)

#### Testing & Verification
- **FR-011**: System MUST include unit tests for all custom React components (StatusBar, VoygenWelcome)
- **FR-012**: System MUST include integration tests for all backend API endpoints (`/api/voygen/*` routes)
- **FR-013**: System MUST include end-to-end tests covering critical user journeys (login, chat interaction, StatusBar display, MCP server connectivity)
- **FR-014**: System MUST complete a full build without errors (zero tolerance for build failures)
- **FR-015**: System MUST start and serve requests on the configured port (backend on 3080, frontend dev on 3090 or production build served by backend)
- **FR-016-TEST**: All test suites (unit, integration, E2E) MUST pass before deployment to Render.com

#### Structure & Organization
- **FR-016**: Build output MUST be production-ready and deployable to Render.com (includes Docker configuration, environment variables, health checks, and service definitions)
- **FR-017**: Configuration files MUST specify all required environment variables (to be identified during implementation - includes MCP server URLs, database connections, API keys)
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide documentation of the rebuild process for future reference (step-by-step guide suitable for other developers to reproduce)

### Key Entities

- **LibreChat Application**: The base open-source chat UI framework being customized, includes frontend (React/Vite) and backend (Node.js/Express) components
- **Voygent Customizations**: Set of modifications including:
  - Branding assets (logo, favicon, theme CSS)
  - Custom React components (StatusBar for token tracking, VoygenWelcome)
  - Recoil state management atoms for Voygent features
  - Backend API routes for trip status, token usage, MCP health
- **Build Artifacts**: Compiled and bundled files ready for deployment, includes optimized frontend assets and backend server code
- **Configuration**: Environment variables, server settings, MCP server definitions required for application to function
- **Test Verification Results**: Evidence that the rebuilt application functions correctly with all customizations working

2. ~~**Repository Structure**: Should this replace the existing `apps/librechat` directory or create a new structure? Should it build within Voygent_ai_2 repo or elsewhere?~~ **RESOLVED**: Replace existing `apps/librechat/` in Voygent_ai_2 repo
3. ~~**Testing Criteria**: What specific tests define "works"? Manual verification only, or automated tests required?~~ **RESOLVED**: Full test suite (unit + integration + E2E)
4. ~~**Deployment Target**: Is this for local development verification only, or should it be production-ready for Render.com deployment?~~ **RESOLVED**: Production-ready for Render.com deployment
