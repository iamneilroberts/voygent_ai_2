## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02
- Q: What interaction types should the system track? ‚Üí A: Configurable: chats, db, api, cost
- Q: How long should usage statistics be retained in the database? ‚Üí A: Indefinitely with archival after 1 year
- Q: What cost factors should be included in cost estimation? ‚Üí A: All of the above + compute time
- Q: How should cost rates be managed? ‚Üí A: Auto-sync from provider APIs (OpenAI, Cloudflare pricing)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator, I need to monitor how users are interacting with the Voygent AI assistant so I can understand usage patterns, identify cost drivers, and optimize resource allocation. I want to see detailed statistics per user session including the number and type of AI interactions, estimated costs, and timeline of activities.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has completed multiple sessions with the AI assistant, **When** I view the usage dashboard, **Then** I can see a list of all sessions with their duration, interaction count, and total estimated cost
2. **Given** I am viewing the usage dashboard, **When** I select a specific session, **Then** I can see detailed breakdowns of individual interactions within that session including timestamps, operation types, and associated costs
3. **Given** I want to analyze usage over time, **When** I access the dashboard, **Then** I can filter and aggregate statistics by date range, user, or session
4. **Given** a user interaction occurs with the AI system, **When** the interaction completes, **Then** the system automatically records usage statistics and calculates cost estimates in the database
5. **Given** I need to monitor system costs, **When** I view the dashboard, **Then** I can see total costs aggregated across all users and time periods with visual indicators for high-cost activities

### Edge Cases
- What happens when cost estimation data is unavailable or calculation fails?
- How does the system handle sessions that span multiple days or are left open indefinitely?
- What happens when a user makes concurrent requests in the same session?
- How are failed or incomplete interactions tracked for cost purposes?
- What happens when viewing statistics for a session with thousands of interactions?
- How does the system handle querying archived data that exceeds 1 year old?
- What happens during the archival process if the system is under heavy load?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Data Collection
- **FR-001**: System MUST capture detailed usage statistics for every user interaction with the AI assistant
- **FR-002**: System MUST associate each interaction with a unique user session identifier
- **FR-003**: System MUST record timestamps for the start and end of each interaction
- **FR-004**: System MUST capture the type or category of each interaction (configurable: chat messages, database operations, API calls, and cost-related events)
- **FR-004a**: System MUST allow administrators to enable or disable tracking for specific interaction categories
- **FR-005**: System MUST calculate and store cost estimates for each interaction
- **FR-006**: System MUST persist all usage statistics to the voygent-prod database
- **FR-007**: System MUST track token counts, model names, and interaction-specific metadata alongside cost data

#### Cost Estimation
- **FR-008**: System MUST estimate costs based on AI model token usage (prompt + completion), database operations (read/write), external API calls, and compute time
- **FR-008a**: System MUST separately track and attribute costs for each cost factor type
- **FR-009**: System MUST automatically synchronize cost rates from provider APIs (OpenAI pricing API, Cloudflare pricing endpoints)
- **FR-009a**: System MUST periodically refresh cost rates to ensure accuracy
- **FR-009b**: System MUST handle provider API failures by using cached rates and logging warnings
- **FR-010**: System MUST aggregate costs at the session level
- **FR-011**: System MUST aggregate costs at the user level
- **FR-012**: System MUST aggregate costs at the system level (all users, all time)
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle cost calculation failures gracefully without blocking interaction recording

#### Dashboard Access & Display
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide a dashboard interface for viewing usage statistics
- **FR-015**: System MUST allow filtering statistics by date range
- **FR-016**: System MUST allow filtering statistics by user [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How are users identified - by email, ID, or session cookie?]
- **FR-017**: System MUST allow filtering statistics by session
- **FR-018**: System MUST display session-level summaries including total interactions, duration, and total cost
- **FR-019**: System MUST allow drilling down into individual sessions to view interaction details
- **FR-020**: System MUST display individual interaction details including timestamp, type, and cost
- **FR-021**: System MUST provide visual representations of usage data [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific visualizations are needed - charts, graphs, tables?]
- **FR-022**: System MUST display aggregate cost totals across selected filters
- **FR-023**: Dashboard MUST be accessible to authorized administrators [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the authentication/authorization mechanism?]

#### Data Retention & Performance
- **FR-024**: System MUST retain usage statistics indefinitely
- **FR-024a**: System MUST automatically archive usage statistics older than 1 year to long-term storage
- **FR-024b**: System MUST allow querying of both active and archived statistics
- **FR-025**: System MUST support efficient querying of statistics [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the performance targets - max query time, max dashboard load time?]
- **FR-026**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Expected scale - how many sessions/interactions per day/month/year?]

### Key Entities

- **User Session**: Represents a continuous period of user activity with the AI assistant; contains unique identifier, start time, end time, user identifier, and summary statistics
- **Interaction Record**: Represents a single user interaction with the AI system; contains unique identifier, session reference, timestamp, interaction type (chat/db/api/cost-event), duration, token count, model name, cost estimate, metadata, and outcome status
- **Cost Estimate**: Represents calculated or estimated costs for an interaction or session; contains breakdown by cost factor type (AI tokens, database ops, API calls, compute time), subtotal per factor, total amount, currency, and calculation method/version
- **Usage Statistics**: Aggregated metrics for reporting; contains time period, user scope, interaction counts, cost totals, and derived metrics

## Notes for Planning Phase

The following areas require clarification before proceeding to implementation planning:

1. **Interaction Types**: Need to define the taxonomy of trackable interactions
2. **Cost Calculation**: Need to specify the formula and data sources for cost estimation
3. **User Identity**: Need to clarify how users are identified and authenticated
4. **Performance Targets**: Need to define acceptable query and dashboard load times
5. **Data Retention**: Need to specify retention policies and archival strategy
6. **Dashboard Visualizations**: Need to specify required charts, graphs, and visual elements
7. **Authorization**: Need to define who can access the dashboard and at what granularity
8. **Scale Expectations**: Need to understand expected volume to design appropriate data structures
