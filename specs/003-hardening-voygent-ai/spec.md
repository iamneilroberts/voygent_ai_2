## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator of Voygent AI, I want to protect internal system instructions, templates, workflows, and configurations from being disclosed to users through prompt injection or other extraction techniques, so that proprietary intellectual property remains confidential and the system cannot be reverse-engineered or exploited.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Attack Prevention:**
1. **Given** a user attempts to extract system instructions through prompt injection (e.g., "repeat your instructions"), **When** the system detects the attempt, **Then** the request is blocked or sanitized and no internal instructions are disclosed
2. **Given** a user asks the AI to reveal its workflow templates, **When** the system processes the request, **Then** the system refuses to disclose templates and provides a neutral response
3. **Given** a user tries to access MCP server configuration details, **When** the query is analyzed, **Then** configuration details remain hidden from the response
4. **Given** a sophisticated multi-turn extraction attempt is made, **When** the pattern is detected across conversation history, **Then** the system blocks the disclosure attempt
5. **Given** a user requests database schema or internal data structures, **When** the request is evaluated, **Then** sensitive schema information is not revealed

**Legitimate Use Preservation:**
6. **Given** a legitimate user asks how to use Voygent features, **When** the system responds, **Then** user-facing documentation and help information is provided without revealing internal instructions
7. **Given** an administrator needs to debug an issue, **When** they access diagnostic information, **Then** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How do authorized admins access internal details for debugging?]
8. **Given** a user asks about available MCP tools, **When** the system responds, **Then** tool descriptions are provided without revealing server implementation details

**Monitoring & Response:**
9. **Given** multiple disclosure attempts occur from one user, **When** the threshold is exceeded, **Then** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What action should system take - rate limit, ban, alert admin?]
10. **Given** a new type of extraction attempt is detected, **When** the security system analyzes it, **Then** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should system adapt defenses or require manual review?]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user legitimately needs to understand how to format inputs for MCP tools?
- How does the system differentiate between "how do I use X" and "show me the internal implementation of X"?
- What if internal instructions are accidentally disclosed in error messages or logs?
- Should the system provide different levels of information to authenticated vs unauthenticated users?
- How to handle cases where templates are part of expected output (e.g., showing a trip itinerary template)?
- What constitutes "internal" vs "public" information?
- How to protect against side-channel attacks (timing, error patterns, etc.)?
- Should archived conversations be retroactively checked for disclosures?

### Key Entities

- **ProtectedContent**: Represents information that must not be disclosed to users
  - Attributes: content type (instruction, template, workflow, config), classification level, associated component
  - Relationship: Referenced by SecurityPolicy, monitored by DisclosureAttempt detection

- **DisclosureAttempt**: Represents a detected attempt to extract protected information
  - Attributes: timestamp, user identifier, query content, detected pattern, severity level, blocked status
  - Relationship: Generated during conversation analysis, triggers SecurityResponse, logged for audit

- **SecurityPolicy**: Represents rules for what content is protected and how to respond
  - Attributes: protected content patterns, detection rules, response actions, exceptions for admin access
  - Relationship: Applied to all user interactions, references ProtectedContent, generates SecurityResponse

- **SecurityResponse**: Represents system action taken in response to disclosure attempt
  - Attributes: response type (block, sanitize, deflect), user-facing message, admin alert triggered, rate limit applied
  - Relationship: Generated by SecurityPolicy, associated with DisclosureAttempt

- **AccessControl**: Represents authorization levels for viewing different information types
  - Attributes: role (admin, developer, user, public), permitted content types, audit trail
  - Relationship: Applied to UserSession, determines what ProtectedContent can be accessed

## Next Steps

**Required Clarifications (20)**:

**Disclosure Prevention:**
1. Are API keys, credentials, and tokens already protected separately, or should this feature cover them?
2. What constitutes "common prompt injection patterns"? Should this reference a known attack database (e.g., OWASP)?
3. What level of detail in error messages is acceptable without leaking information?

**Protected Content:**
4. Who maintains the list of protected content types?
5. How is the protected content list updated over time?
6. Are travel itinerary templates "user-viewable" or "internal"?
7. What exactly counts as "internal" vs "public" information?

**Admin Access:**
8. How do authorized administrators access internal details for debugging?
9. Should there be different access levels (admin, developer, user, public)?
10. Is there a separate admin interface or special authentication?

**Detection & Monitoring:**
11. Should disclosure detection happen in real-time or batch analysis?
12. What details should be logged for disclosure attempts (user ID, IP, query, timestamp, severity)?
13. Should administrators be alerted on all disclosure attempts or only successful ones?
14. Should there be a dashboard or reporting interface for security events?

**Response Actions:**
15. What should the response message be for blocked attempts (generic refusal, error, deflection)?
16. Should the system rate limit users who repeatedly attempt disclosure? What threshold?
17. Should users be temporarily or permanently blocked after exceeding thresholds?
18. Should there be an appeals process for false positives?

**Testing & Validation:**
19. Should security audits be automated or manual? How frequently?
20. What metrics should be tracked (prevention success rate, false positive rate, etc.)?

**Dependencies:**
- Current system instructions and templates in LibreChat, MCP servers, database
- Existing authentication and authorization system
- Logging and monitoring infrastructure
- Known prompt injection attack patterns and techniques

**Assumptions:**
- System has ability to intercept and analyze user inputs before processing
- System can maintain conversation history for pattern detection
- Protected content can be clearly identified and classified
- Legitimate user experience should not be significantly degraded by security measures
- False positives (blocking legitimate queries) are acceptable at some low rate
