# Feature Specification: Independent Trip Validation System

**Feature Branch**: `001-trip-validation`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Write a plan to add external validation to the voygent.ai app where every element of a trip plan is independently verified by another LLM and citations for the verification (source, datestamp, recommended correction, etc) are saved in the trip database."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a traveler using Voygent to plan my trip, I need confidence that all trip information (flight times, hotel addresses, restaurant hours, attraction availability) is accurate and up-to-date, so I don't encounter surprises or invalid information during my travels.

When Voygent generates a trip plan element (e.g., "Visit Louvre Museum on Tuesday 2:00 PM"), the system independently verifies:
- The museum is open on that day/time
- Address and directions are current
- Admission requirements (tickets, reservations) are documented
- Recent traveler issues (renovations, closures) are flagged

All verification results are stored with citations so users can review source credibility and freshness.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** Voygent generates a restaurant recommendation, **When** validation runs, **Then** the system confirms hours, location, phone number, and flags if the establishment has closed or moved (with citation source and date)

2. **Given** a flight itinerary is created, **When** validation runs, **Then** the system verifies flight numbers exist, times match airline schedules, and flags if flight is commonly delayed or cancelled (with historical data source)

3. **Given** a hotel booking suggestion, **When** validation runs, **Then** the system confirms hotel operates at that address, validates amenities claimed match current listings, and flags negative reviews about incorrect information (with review platform citation)

4. **Given** an attraction visit is planned, **When** validation runs, **Then** the system verifies current operating hours, entry requirements, temporary closures, and provides link to official source

5. **Given** validation identifies a discrepancy, **When** user views trip plan, **Then** the system displays the original information, the validator's recommended correction, severity level (INFO/WARNING/CRITICAL), and citation with date/source

### Edge Cases
- What happens when validation LLM contradicts the planning LLM but both have valid sources with different dates? (Display both with recency indicators)
- How does system handle attractions with seasonal hours or variable schedules? (Flag as "Schedule varies - verify before visit" with last checked date)
- What if validation cannot find recent information about an element? (Mark as "Unverified - last known info from [date]")
- How does system handle rate limiting on validation LLM API? (Queue validations, process in background, mark as "Pending verification")
- What happens when user edits validated information? (Re-trigger validation, expire old citation)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST validate every distinct trip element independently (each restaurant, attraction, flight, hotel, activity)
- **FR-002**: System MUST perform validation using an LLM separate from the primary planning LLM
- **FR-003**: System MUST capture validation results including: element verified, validator judgment (VERIFIED/DISCREPANCY/UNVERIFIED), recommended correction (if discrepancy), severity (INFO/WARNING/CRITICAL), source citation, validation timestamp
- **FR-004**: System MUST store validation results in trip database associated with the specific trip element
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to view validation details for any trip element
- **FR-006**: System MUST flag elements with CRITICAL discrepancies prominently in trip display
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow re-validation of elements (manual trigger or automatic on edit)
- **FR-008**: System MUST track validation history (when validated, by which model version, previous results)
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide citation links to original sources when available
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle validation failures gracefully (timeout, API error, no sources found)
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate elements asynchronously (not blocking trip plan generation)
- **FR-012**: Validator LLM MUST be configured in critic mode: rewarded for finding discrepancies, not for approving information
- **FR-013**: System MUST prioritize validation of time-sensitive information (hours, closures, schedules) over static information (addresses, phone numbers)
- **FR-014**: System MUST re-validate time-sensitive elements periodically (daily for trip elements within 7 days of travel date)
- **FR-015**: System MUST log all validation requests and responses for audit trail

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Trip Element**: Individual component of a trip plan (restaurant, attraction, flight, hotel, activity) that requires validation
- **Validation Record**: Result of independent verification including citation, timestamp, severity, recommended correction
- **Citation**: Source information for validation (URL, publication date, source name, excerpt/quote)
- **Validation History**: Time-series record of all validations for a trip element (to track when information changed)
- **Validation Queue**: Pending validation requests (for rate limiting and async processing)
