## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a travel agent using Voygent AI, I want to see the Voygent.ai branding when I open LibreChat, have all MCP servers automatically enabled, automatically start in travel agent assistant mode, and monitor my token usage in real-time, so that I can manage costs and immediately begin working on client trips with all necessary tools available without manual configuration.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a travel agent opens LibreChat for the first time, **When** the interface loads, **Then** they see Voygent.ai branding, all required MCP servers are enabled, and they are immediately in travel agent assistant mode
2. **Given** LibreChat has started with MCP servers, **When** the user needs to use a tool (fetch web content, query database, publish document), **Then** the MCP tool is immediately available without manual activation
3. **Given** a conversation is in progress, **When** tokens are consumed, **Then** the token usage indicator updates in real-time showing current usage
4. **Given** the token usage indicator is visible, **When** the user clicks/hovers on it, **Then** they see detailed breakdown of token consumption [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What detail level - per message, per session, cumulative?]
5. **Given** LibreChat is already configured, **When** a user refreshes or reopens, **Then** travel agent assistant mode and MCP servers persist as defaults
6. **Given** an MCP server becomes unavailable, **When** the user attempts to use its tools, **Then** the system displays an error message [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should system retry? Show fallback options?]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when token usage data is unavailable or delayed?
- How does the system handle token usage display for multiple concurrent conversations?
- What should display if no token usage has occurred yet in the session?
- Should token usage reset per session, per day, or persist indefinitely?
- How does branding appear on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)?
- What happens if an MCP server fails to initialize on startup?
- Should users be able to manually disable auto-enabled MCP servers?
- How does the system handle MCP server version updates or configuration changes?
